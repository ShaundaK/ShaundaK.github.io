									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hello! Thanks for taking the time out to learn more about me. My career includes many years as a case manager in non-profit and now, web development!</p>
                  <p>When I have time to unwind, I am usually painting, journaling or biking. When I have time and money to unwind, you will catch me on the plane flying to a warm destination.

                <h2>Web Development</h2> 
                <p>During my enrollment at Actualize Coding Bootcamp, I had the oppurtunity to create a messaging app called, Little Elehant. This app is for parents who are looking for inexpensive or free baby products from other parents. This app was created with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js and SQL. I integrated an API from MapBox for users to estimate the distance to and from other users.</p>

                  <h2>Artist</h2>
                <p>One of my favorite things to do is paint. I began my journey in 2015. My friend came to visit me and brought along some art supplies. I thought nothing of it, but as soon as the brush touched the canvas, my life changed forever. </p><p>Painting is a way for me to translate my emotions into something that's not only tangible, but colorful and cosmic. Like painting, web development begins as an idea that you want to share with others in hopes of creating something that will be beneficial to someone's life.</p> <p>In my journey with the arts, I've learned that there's many trials and errors. A masterpiece cannot be created overnight. It takes time, patience and persistance in order for a piece to feel complete and appreciated.</p>

                <h2>Case Management</h2> <!-- may delete -->
                <p>I've always had a knack for helping people through guidance and encouragement. I have had the oppurtunity to work with diverse populations; such as the homeless, single-family households and those who struggle with substance abuse. My direct interaction with clients have given me the ability to communicate to a wide array of people stemming from different backgrounds. Case management has also taught me that there is no such thing as a 'one solution solves all' approach. Creating indvidualized plans with clients not only show support towards their goals, but also that there a many different avenues that can be accessed to achieve their goal.</p>
